    "# Q1. What is the meaning of multiple inheritance?\n",
    "Multiple inheritance. Multiple inheritance is a feature of some object-oriented computer programming languages in which a class can inherit characteristics and features from more than one superclass. It is distinct from single inheritance, where a class may only inherit from one particular superclass."
