The procedure caller can use the addition EXCEPTIONS of the statements meth( ... ) or CALL FUNCTION to assign return codes for the system field sy-subrc to the exceptions the caller wants to handle and evaluate them after the call."

This option is a temporary measure - eventually the string-based standard exceptions will be removed from the language altogether."
