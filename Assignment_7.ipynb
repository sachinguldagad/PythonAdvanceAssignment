    "A try statement includes keyword try, followed by a colon (:) and a suite of code in which exceptions may occur. It has one or more clauses.\n",
    "During the execution of the try statement, if no exceptions occurred then, the interpreter ignores the exception handlers for that specific try statement.\n",
    "In case, if any exception occurs in a try suite, the try suite expires and program control transfers to the matching except handler following the try suite.\n",
