    "The str() built-in is used to cast an instance of a class to a str object, or more appropriately, to obtain a user-friendly string representation of the object which can be read by a normal user rather than the programmer. You can define the string format your object should be displayed in when passed to str() by defining the __str__() method in your class. Moreover, __str__() is the method that is used by Python when you call print() on your object."

You can change its behavior using the __getitem__() special method.\n",

    "With the help of operator overloading, you can redefine the majority of the C++ operators. You can also use operator overloading to perform different operations using one operator.\n"
