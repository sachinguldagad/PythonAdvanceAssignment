    "NumPy library provides objects for multi-dimensional arrays, whereas Pandas is capable of offering an in-memory 2d table object called DataFrame. NumPy consumes less memory as compared to Pandas. Indexing of the Series objects is quite slow as compared to NumPy arrays.\n",
    "To convert an array to a dataframe with Python you need to 1) have your NumPy array (e.g., np_array), and 2) use the pd. DataFrame() constructor like this: df = pd. DataFrame(np_array, columns=['Column1', 'Column2']) . Remember, that each column in your NumPy array needs to be named with columns."
